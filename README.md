Dear candidate,

Here at Flexisource, we are usually assigned by client a couple of data processing tasks from multiple sources such as database including data from files like XML.

To test your knowledge in C#.NET development, presented here is a new mvc dotnet core application. You are assigned to complete the solution based on the following specifications:

1. The XML files in each client should be enumerated as JSON data based on the configured client settings in app settings file. 
Each client has its own preferred file format and ordering of files.<br><br>
**Client A** requires enumerating the file based on the ff order: **shovel, waghor, blaze, discus**.<br>
**Client B** requires enumerating the file based on the ff order: **orca, widget, eclair, talon**.<br><br>
When the files contains the same name, the file should be ordered based on date, first in first out basis.<br><br>
It is also important that the files to be enumerated are only the files that comply to the client's preferred format, the file name format are what the majority of the files on the client's respective file folders are.

2. To test your knowledge in objected oriented programming, we require the the core functionality of the solution to be confirmed and verified through unit tests.<br><br>

**Please submit your answer as a PR.**

Goodluck and happy coding!
